# Project Name

The Salary Calculator

## Description

- The website has input fields for the First Name, Last Name, ID Number, Job Title, and Annual Salary of an employee.
- A submit button collects the information, stores it to calculate monthly costs, and appends the information to the DOM, then clears the input fields.
- The stored information is used to calculate monthly costs and append them to the DOM and if the total monthly cost exceeds $20,000, adds a red background to the monthly cost of the item.
- There is a delete button that can remove employees from the DOM and removes their salary from the total monthly cost.
